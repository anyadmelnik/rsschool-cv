### Biography
I have graduated from the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation and currently have a degree in law. During my education I spent half a year studying abroad in the Università di Bologna and for me it was a thrilling experience.

During my law career I understood that my passion has changed and other field of work gives me much more pleasure. When we started to integrate Jira as our task manager at my workplace I was involed in a process of communication with our IT team, Jira team and I helped them to make that system really comfortable for us. I described and explained what we needed exactly and I was in love with the process. After that I understood that I want to be on the other side of apps and be able to develope different useful products for users.

I believe, that my ability to learn and my purposefulness will help me to acuire hard skills and started career as a Frontend Developer.
